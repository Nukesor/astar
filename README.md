This is going to be an A* Library, that builds upon the Lovetoys.  
Everything is working fine right now, but we need to bring this library into a form that allows fast and easy deployment.  

If you want to use it anyway: Copy the `Structure` and the `Algorithm` folder into your project.

Check the main.lua on how to use this library. A detailed documentation will follow soon
